/**
Pick only index signatures from the given object type, leaving out all explicitly defined properties.

This is the counterpart of `OmitIndexSignature`.

When you use a type that will iterate through an object that has indexed keys and explicitly defined keys you end up with a type where only the indexed keys are kept. This is because `keyof` of an indexed type always returns `string | number | symbol`, because every key is possible in that object. With this type, you can save the indexed keys and reinject them later, like in the second example below.

export type PickIndexSignature<T> = {
	[K in keyof T as {} extends Record<K, unknown> ? K : never]: T[K]
}
